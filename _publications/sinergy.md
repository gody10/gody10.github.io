The project “energy oPtimization of building Internet Of
Things Infrastructures in a Stratified way” presented a holistic approach
for an AI-enabled EMS for building-level energy management and maximizing the available renewable energy sources utilization. Specifically,
the solution integrated a PV generation forecasting module, a building
energy demand forecasting module, and an energy task scheduling and
optimization component. This paper presents the methodology and preliminary results regarding the PV generation forecasting and energy task
scheduling modules tested for the premises of Institute Mihajlo Pupin.
