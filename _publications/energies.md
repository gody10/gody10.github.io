This survey paper explores the cybersecurity certification requirements defined by the Sun- 1
Spec Alliance for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) devices, focusing on aspects such as software 2
updates, device communications, authentication mechanisms, device security, logging, and test pro- 3
cedures. The SunSpec Cybersecurity Standards mandate support for remote and automated software 4
updates, secure communication protocols, stringent authentication practices, and robust logging 5
mechanisms to ensure operational integrity. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implementation of 6
the SAE J3072 standard using the IEEE 2030.5 protocol, emphasizing the secure interactions between 7
electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) for functionalities like 8
vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. This research also examines the SunSpec Modbus standard, which 9
enhances the interoperability among DER system components, facilitating compliance with grid 10
interconnection standards. The paper also analyzes the existing SunSpec Device Information Models, 11
which standardize data exchange formats for DER systems across communication interfaces. Finally, 12
the paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the energy storage cybersecurity specification and 13
the blockchain cybersecurity requirements as proposed by the SunSpec Alliance. 14
