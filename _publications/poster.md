With buildings accounting for a significant portion of the
grid’s total energy demand, it is evident that consumers
should be engaged in energy efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach that conducts energy efficiency recommendations for buildings, in the form
of load-shift suggestions for different devices/assets. The
adopted methodology can continuously learn consumer energy behavior and preferences to minimize energy costs,
while preserving comfort by jointly training a single agent
for all the building assets. The agent utilizes user feedback on
the recommendations and integrates it in the reward function. Preliminary experiment results with simulated data
show that the agent’s reward is increasing throughout time.
