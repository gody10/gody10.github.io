The rapid growth of data and computing needs
in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) necessitates efficient
mechanisms for optimizing the resource management in e-health
applications. This paper presents the NEMESIS framework,
which enables the users to determine their optimal Multi-Access
Edge Computing (MEC) server selection and data offloading
strategies by considering the reliability of the MEC servers
based on individual interactions and shared user experiences.
A comprehensive system model is introduced that defines the
users’ interactions, the data offloading processes, and the impact
of various IoMT devices, along with a novel utility function that
evaluates the tradeoffs in the MEC server selection and task
offloading. Additionally, a reliability model is proposed that in-
corporates the direct user interactions and their peers evaluations
of the MEC servers’ computing services, while a regret learning
mechanism is designed to optimize the users’ strategies under
varying information scenarios. The results demonstrate that
the NEMESIS framework operates efficiently in real-time and
outperforms state-of-the-art scheduling and offloading schemes
in terms of latency and energy consumption.
