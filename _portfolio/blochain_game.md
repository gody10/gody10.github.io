## Developing a Card Game with Secure Assets

### Description
In this project we showcased Distributed Ledger Technologies and
emphasized on the Ethereum Blockchain technology. Furthermore, we analyzed the
possible fusion between the Ethereum platform and the gaming industry which can
drastically improve gaming applications and create a whole new genre. Moreover,
we created a Blockchain - Card game and evaluated its strengths and weaknesses.

### Technologies Used

- **Unity** – Learned to code a game from scratch in Unity
- **Blockchain Technology** – Got hands on experience with Solidity coding and deeply understood Ethereum blockchain
