## BSc Projects

### Description
This is a collection of all the projects that I completed over the course of 4 years. Those complicated assignments forced me to get hands on experience with many different areas of Computer Science and understand the value of teamwork and leadership. It is apparent that the topic that I did most of these projects in was Machine Learnine, which interested me the most. 


### Details

The full list of topics covered here are the following:

- Applied Machine Learning for Weather, Song and Policy belief prediction
- Deep Machine Learning for NLP tasks such as movie review classification
- Diploma thesis on Solidity and Unity
- SQL Database building and manipulation
- Java App Development
- C++ Image Photoshop
- LSTM and Time-series prediction using Deep Machine Learning
- VHDL and Assembly
- MultiThreading
- Communication Networks
- Information Systems
- Android App for Tik Tok implementing Distributed Systems
