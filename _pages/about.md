Hi I am Odysseas (pronounced as oh - dh ee s - s EH - aa s). I am looking for PhD opportunities in the field of Computer Vision, NLP, Reinforcement Learning, or in intersections of those. I am extremely motivated and passionate about my research and will work hard to make the most out of every opportunity.

My research interests are focused on leveraging AI to solve real-life problems. I believe the future will be shaped by intelligent agents, profoundly transforming society—from everyday jobs to the education system. I have extensive experience with problem modeling and solving, leveraging Optimization techniques, Game Theory and Reinforcement learning. I also have hands-on experience with Large Language Models, Transformer architectures, and Embedding models such as BERT, as well as Computer Vision architectures — all of which I have applied to tasks such as patent prediction and classification, chatbot development, residential energy management training, and more.

My prior studies include a MSc, a BSc and a Minor degree. More specifically, I completed my MSc and my BSc in Computer Science at the [Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)](https://aueb.gr/en) under the supervision of Prof. [George C. Polyzos](https://www.aueb.gr/en/faculty_page/polyzos-george) and my Minor in Philosophy at [Deree - The American College of Greece](https://www.acg.edu/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about my research! The time in my area is: 
<span id="current-time"></span>
<div>
  <script>
    function updateTime() {
      const now = new Date();
      const options = { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', second: '2-digit', timeZone: 'America/Denver', hour12: true };
      document.getElementById('current-time').textContent = now.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', options);
    }
    setInterval(updateTime, 1000);
    updateTime();
  </script>
</div>
