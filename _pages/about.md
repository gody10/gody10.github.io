Hi I am Odysseas (pronounced as oh - dh ee s - s EH - aa s). I am currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of prof. Sotirios Tsaftaris. My research interests are focused on leveraging AI to solve real-life problems. I believe the future will be shaped by intelligent agents, profoundly transforming society—from everyday jobs to the education and health systems. I have extensive experience with problem modeling and solving, leveraging Optimization techniques, Game Theory and Reinforcement learning. I also have hands-on experience with Large Language Models, Transformer architectures, and Embedding models such as BERT, as well as Computer Vision architectures — all of which I have applied to tasks such as patent prediction and classification, chatbot development, residential energy management training, and more. My PhD topic is Causal AI in the field of medical imaging.

My prior studies include a MSc, a BSc and a Minor degree. More specifically, I completed my MSc and my BSc in Computer Science at the [Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)](https://aueb.gr/en) under the supervision of Prof. [George C. Polyzos](https://www.aueb.gr/en/faculty_page/polyzos-george) and my Minor in Philosophy at [Deree - The American College of Greece](https://www.acg.edu/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about my research! The time in my area is: 
<span id="current-time"></span>
<div>
  <script>
    function updateTime() {
      const now = new Date();
      const options = { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', second: '2-digit', timeZone: 'Europe/Athens', hour12: true };
      document.getElementById('current-time').textContent = now.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', options);
    }
    setInterval(updateTime, 1000);
    updateTime();
  </script>
</div>
