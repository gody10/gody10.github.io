Hi I am Odysseas (pronounced as oh - dh ee s - s EH - aa s). I am currently a PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/eirini-eleni-tsiropoulou/home),  and a member of the PROTON Lab. 

My research interests are focused on leveraging AI to solve real-life problems. I believe the future will be shaped by intelligent agents, profoundly transforming society—from everyday jobs to the education system. I have extensive experience with problem modeling and solving, leveraging Optimization techniques, Game Theory and Reinforcement learning. I also have hands-on experience with Large Language Models, Transformer architectures, embedding models such as BERT, and computer vision models, which I’ve applied to solve problems like patent prediction and classification, chat bot creation and residential energy manager training.

My prior studies include a MSc, a BSc and a Minor degree. More specifically, I completed my MSc and my BSc in Computer Science at the [Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)](https://aueb.gr/en) under the supervision of Prof. [George C. Polyzos](https://www.aueb.gr/en/faculty_page/polyzos-george) and my Minor in Philosophy at [Deree - The American College of Greece](https://www.acg.edu/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about my research! The time in my area is: 
<span id="current-time"></span>
<div>
  <script>
    function updateTime() {
      const now = new Date();
      const options = { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', second: '2-digit', timeZone: 'America/Denver', hour12: true };
      document.getElementById('current-time').textContent = now.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', options);
    }
    setInterval(updateTime, 1000);
    updateTime();
  </script>
</div>
